# flat-website
Old attemp to create a website after watching the "Complete web development course 2.0" on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/).

List of things to fix:
- Picture preview on all flat pages
- English version
- Prices page
- Index page location
- Link to flat.css
